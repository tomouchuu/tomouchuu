### aka. Tom, Tomo, Tomouchuu

Hey there, I'm a frontend web developer based in Essex / London where I'm currently working within **Web Security**.

Mostly work in React using Next and Ember, currently exploring Solid!

Outside of work, you can find me visitng Japan 4 times a year, drumming away, catching up on social media and playing Final Fantasy 14 which has an unlimited free trial up to level 60 that includes the award winning expansion Heavensward.

Feel free to reach out to me on my socials!

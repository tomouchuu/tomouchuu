### aka. Tom, Tomo, Tomouchuu

Hey there, I'm a frontend web developer based in Essex / London where I'm currently working within **Web Security**.

Right now I'm in EmberJS for my employer, but I have experience working in React (Next or Tanstack), a little Solid and currently messing most around in Svelte.

Outside of work, you can find me visitng Japan 4 times a year, drumming away, catching up on social media and previously playing Final Fantasy 14 which has an unlimited free trial up to level 60 that includes the award winning expansion Stormblood to a decently high level.

Feel free to reach out to me on my socials!

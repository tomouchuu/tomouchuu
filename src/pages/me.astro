      <p>So hello there, I'm {personal.name}. I'm {ageText(personal.birthday)}, from {personal.location} and currently {employmentText(personal)}.</p>
      <p class="my-4">I'm a frontend developer with a focus on building components with javascript frameworks like reactjs & vuejs along with knowledge of a combination of most css solutions (css, scss, less, stylus, postcss, css in js). Storybook is ‚ù§. I've also done a small small bit of backend work, either in javascript with node or php where I've used laravel.</p>
      <p class="my-4">Outside of coding, I'm a big fan of things japanese but mostly enjoy music (and mostly <a class="underline" href="/idols" title="Tomo's favourite idols">IDOL</a> at that) and aesthetics. I try to get over there every year at least and I'm trying to learn the language via a tutor, self teaching and going to meetups.</p>
      <p class="my-4">I play the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy 14 to a mid-to-high level (in my opinion). I tend to play support jobs such as Bard or Dancer to help my team mates increase damage to clear fights (It also has a pretty good story too I guess). Main achievement there is clearing an ultimate on the same expansion which took over 1150 attempts over a 2 month time period! You can find out more about my character <a class="underline" href="/ff14" title="Tomo's FF14 character">here</a>.</p>
      <p class="my-4">I also play drums occasionally, used to be in a band but I still keep playing to keep skills up, because of that I do finger drum in the office (sorry not sorry).</p>

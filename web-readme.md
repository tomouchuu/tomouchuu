# TOMO@UCHUU Personal Site V11 - Svelte/Elysia -

Wild but I think I've wanted to try something in svelte for a while and after taking more of a look there are a few similarities with how I work in ember with the day job so I'm giving it a go!
Still using elysia for the backend cause eden is cool, comfy anime mascot and I wanna support the dev so the more things that use it the better right?

Though if I was to do a new version of this again, I'd maybe switch from elsyia to just svelte and then use pnpm and go a bit more into the vite+ place because I kinda feel like that's the direction we'll go at my day job.

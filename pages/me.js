Storybook is ‚ù§. I do also a little bit of backend work, either in javascript with node or php where I use laravel.</p>
            <p className="my-8">Outside of coding, I'm a big fan of things japanese but mostly enjoy music (and mostly <Link href="/idol"><a title="Oshimen list">IDOL</a></Link> at that) and aesthetics. I try to get over there every 2 years at least and I'm trying to learn the language via a tutor, self teaching and going to meetups.</p>
            <p className="my-8">I also play drums occasionally, used to be in a band but I still keep playing to keep skills up, because of that I do finger drum in the office (sorry not sorry).</p>

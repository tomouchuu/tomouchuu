# Thomas Moore

### aka. Tom, Tomo, Tomouchuu

Hey there, I'm a frontend web developer based in Essex / London where I'm currently working within **Web Security**.

Mostly work in React using Next or Gatsby as a framework and take a keen interest in different ways to style websites whether it's using old school css, the OGs of scss/less, css modules, css-in-js, tailwind, etc.

Outside of work, you can find me drumming away, catching up on social media and playing Final Fantasy 14 which has an unlimited free trial up to level 60 that includes the award winning expansion Heavensward.

Feel free to reach out to me on my socials!
